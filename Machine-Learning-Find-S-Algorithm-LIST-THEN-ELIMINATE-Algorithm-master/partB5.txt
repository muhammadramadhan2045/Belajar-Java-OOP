 and there lies the weakness of this algorithm when half the version 
space agrees and the other half disagrees. To make this a better solution
we should be able to give more weightage to certain hypothesis and less to
some others. This may be done by taking assumptions or by taking weights of
certain pairs of inputs. Like say in the weather example given in class,
'sunny' and 'warm' may be given more weightage than sunny and cold. Similar
pairs may be found and the hypothesis that contains such pairs will have
more weightage than ones that do not.
